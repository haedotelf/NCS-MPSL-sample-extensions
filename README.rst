This sample demonstrates how to use :ref:`nrfxlib:mpsl` and basic MPSL Timeslot functionality.


Modified the MPSL sample to include timeslot extensions and interruptions.

Latest nRF Connect version tested with: v2.0.2

For more info on the sample see (here)[https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/samples/mpsl/timeslot/README.html]

For now this is just modified main file to go along with the rest of the files from the MPSL sample.
